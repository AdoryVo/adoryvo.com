  <p>
    Hey! I'm <b class="text-blue-300">Adory</b>, a software engineer with a B.S.
    in Math &amp; Computer Science from <b class="text-sky-">UC San Diego</b>
    pursuing a career in software engineering and potentially teaching afterwards.
    I'm currently a manufacturing test software engineer at J&J Medtech (surgical
    robotics). This website is a web development project of mine where I'll be showcasing
    some of my work! This website is created from scratch with Astro/React and stylized
