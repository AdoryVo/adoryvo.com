			Hey! I'm Adory, a third-year at UC San Diego studying math &amp; computer science 
			to pursue a career in software development and potentially teaching. 
			I have been doing freelance web development for about a year now and this website is a web development project of mine 
			where I'll be showcasing some of my work. 
			This website is created from scratch with Node.js, Express, and EJS and stylized with Tailwind CSS (see the repository for this site for more details).
